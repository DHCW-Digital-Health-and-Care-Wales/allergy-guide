# Allergy Guide

A work space where good clinical and technical user experience can be refined to build out safe practice guidance when working with allergies
## About
### Purpose
* A shared workspace to refine and define public content
### Aims
* **transferable** - content in markdown format (.md files) and other assets for use within Simplfier guides
* **self-contained** - a content's assets (eg images) are stored in the content's folder for portability
### Audience 
 * **clinical** - informaticists, health care workers, patient safety specialists
 * **technical** - software developers and architects, FHIR specialists
 * **business** / product owner - public or private sector partners who have an interest in allergies and patient risks

### Structure
 The workspace should produce a few key outputs for the guide
 * [home](index.md): clear high level description with aims and objective of the guide
   *  what it is
   *  what it is not
 * [data models](data-model.md): clarity on models used and how they relate to one another
 * [use cases](usecase/index.md): the expected sitations where use of allegies records are relevant
   * diagrams
   * examples
   * wireframes
 * FHIR Resources: any specialisations via profiling or other FHIR notation for the FHIR specialist

## Getting started
### Non technical users

Our [working with github](url) page may be useful if you're new to github.

#### Contributing
Work in your own version by creating a branch. When you're ready, ask for your work to be merged with everyone else's with a pull requet. A pull request is just a way to ask for your changes to be 'pulled into' (or merged with) the main version. Once the pull's accepted and the work is merged, you can delete your version. Next time you want to change something, you just repeat the process.

#### Tips
* check you changes in often, lots of small changes are the way to go. Big changes are difficult to merge and undo
* preview changes in your editor before you save them
